Stock_Market_Prediction  

# Project Overview
This project involves using a regression model to predict stock market trends. The model uses historical stock data, and the goal is to visualize and compare the actual and predicted stock prices. The project includes data preprocessing steps like scaling the features and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. The results are visualized using interactive plots that show actual and predicted stock prices over time, enabling an evaluation of the model’s performance.

# Final Conclusion
The project successfully builds a regression model to predict stock prices. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) scores. These metrics help determine how well the model fits the data. The preprocessing steps, such as scaling, contribute to the model's accuracy.
